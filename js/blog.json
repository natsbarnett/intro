As such, I decided to put my knowledge of web development to it. I'll try to update it as much as I can so that I won't get rusty （︶^︶）! <br><br>I initially thought I could use Carrd to do everything I wanted, but I found it way too restricting and I couldn't put all my creativity at it. So here it is! My own Carrd made by my own hands! I'll try to put more features as time goes on as a side project w/ my studies.<br><br> As you probably already seen, I have an old website where I updated all my works I made the past two years, you can find it <a href=\"https://natsbarnett.github.io/portfolio-nats-barnett/\" title=\"See my portfolio here!\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a>.<br>You can also find me here :<br><br>My art accounts<br><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sharkhoney_draws/\" title=\"Follow me on Instagram\" target=\"_blank\">@sharkhoney_draws</a> on Instagram</li><li><a href=\"https://x.com/sharkhoney_draw\" title=\"Follow me on Twitter / X\" target=\"_blank\">@sharkhoney_draw</a> on Twitter</li><li><a href=\"https://sharkhoney-draws.tumblr.com\" title=\"Follow me on Tumblr\" target=\"_blank\">@sharkhoney-draws</a> on Tumblr</li></ul><br>My other accounts<ul><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mugiaoba_daily\" title=\"Follow me on Twitter / X\" target=\"_blank\">@mugiaoba_daily</a> on Twitter</li><li><a href=\"https://x.com/natsbarnett\" title=\"Follow me on Twitter / X\" target=\"_blank\">@natsbarnett</a> on Twitter</li></ul><br>Hope you will enjoy your stay here!<br>Until next time!<br>— Nats"
